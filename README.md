Telling the time by sound 

## Why?
I've always played with telling time via computers. I wrote a CGI script that exported generated JPGs showing the current time in an analog clock.

At a recent Beer.js event, I learned about the Web Audio API, and my first thought was to emulate the tones generated by telephone switching equiptment, and each of them are not one tone but two, so I got two oscillators going.

I then thought that, since we can distinguish two dial tones that share a frequency, it should be possible to use that to produce tones that can indicate a time of the day.
